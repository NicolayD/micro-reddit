# Micro-Reddit    

This is a sample solution for the [Micro-Reddit](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-with-active-record?ref=lnav) project from the [Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails) track at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home).    

It is an exercise for the Rails models, so it won't focus on any views, just the models.
